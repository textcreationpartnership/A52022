            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO THE</hi> CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>THE beſt learned, and wiſeſt Philoſophers, having received no taſte or light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, but only being led and directed by Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, held this for a Principle among themſelves, that MAN was not born to himſelf only, but was framed of Nature ſuch an excellent Creature as he is, to that end, that he might imploy thoſe ſingular gifts wherewith he is beautified, as Wiſdom, Reaſon, Memory, Diſcretion, and Judgment, not only to his own private commodity, but alſo to the profit of his Country, and others. This good opinion ingraffed in their minds by Nature, delivered from one to another by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo from time to time continued among themſelves by conſent: cauſed the beſt able Men among them, ſuch as God and Nature had plentifully endued with knowledge and underſtanding, to leave ſuch worthy Monuments as they did to Poſterity: as <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> good Rules of life and government. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the hidden ſecrets of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy: <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the high myſteries of Aſtronomy: <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyde,</hi> the infallible Principles of Geometry. <hi>Varro,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:33800:3"/>neceſſary obſervations of Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Out of the which, ſo great commodities in all Ages have been reaped, (and as occaſion and good wits have ſerved) have alſo from time to time been encreaſed. If this Principle of theirs be ſound and true (as indeed I take it to be) then of conſequence, one other depending upon the ſame, muſt needs be as true, and that is this: That thoſe Men do neareſt approach to the Rule of uncorrupt Nature, and do beſt deſerve of a Common-wealth, whoſe labours and travails are beſtowed on thoſe things which tend to the beſt end. For by the conſideration of the end whereunto each thing leadeth, the goodneſs and excellency of the thing it ſelf is to be known and eſteemed. As for example: If health either maintained, or recovered be good: then Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, whoſe chief end is to maintain and recover health, muſt needs be good alſo. If good government publickly, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoying of our own privately, be a good thing, and to be commended: then the Law, for that it reſpecteth Juſtice in all actions, and quietneſs, as his chief end, muſt needs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be good, and deſerve the like commendation. And as there be many things, which for this ſelf ſame Reaſon that I have now alledged, are to be accounted good, and praiſe-worthy in their kind: So, I think there is no man ſo far from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that he ſeeth, by the ſelf ſame Argument it muſt needs be inforced, that though many Arts and Sciences be good, for that their ends be good: yet ſome one there is, that is to be accounted as beſt, for that its end is beſt. The chief end of Man in this World, what it is, I think no Chriſtian man ſo ſlenderly inſtructed, that he maketh any doubt thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:33800:3"/>For the very Philoſophers themſelves, of whom I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were fully reſolved, that it was to live well and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and affirmed, that (whereas other Creatures are made groveling, and ſtill beholding the ground as they go) Man was therefore framed ſtreight and upright, that he might always behold Heaven and heavenly things, and ſo by the very ſhape of his body and countenance, be put in mind continually, that albeit he were here for a ſeaſon, as a wandring Pilgrim upon earth, yet his end was, to be a free Citizen, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of Heaven above: And as they by Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture were led ſo to think: ſo we by Faith, and expreſs Commandment, are moved, ſo ſtedfaſtly to believe. If then the knowledge of God and heavenly things, be the chiefeſt end and mark whereat man ought to ſhoot, it muſt needs be concluded, that thoſe Mens ſtudies and labours deſerve the greateſt praiſe, which are employed to the attaining and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of others thereunto. Wherein, as God in all Ages hath always ſtirred up ſome, who have taken great pains therein, to the publick commodity of others: So, in my ſimple judgment, neither this preſent Work, neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof deſerveth the leaſt commendation. And albeit I wot full well, that ſo the Work it ſelf be good, it is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly material what the Workman be: yet, like as good Wine is then beſt, when it is drunk out of a clean Veſſel, and good Meat then moſt delighteth, when the Dreſſer thereof is cleanly: So this Book, which of it ſelf, I doubt not, to be ſuch, that it will be liked of all thoſe who delight in God and godlineſs, I truſt, even for the Author's ſake, it ſhall never awhit the
<pb facs="tcp:33800:4"/>worſe be welcome. Of whoſe ſincere life, and great praiſes, although there is good cauſe why I ſhould ſpeak, for that he hath been of long time throughly known to me, and I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his vertues and integrity to be ſuch, that if I ſhould ſay, there are few like him to be found, I truſt, for ſaying the truth, no good man would be offended: Yet partly for that I am not ignorant, that no man delighteth leſs to hear his own praiſe than he doth: partly for that there be many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why I ſhould rather honour him, than for lack of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient skill and ability, meanly praiſe him: I will leave him to thy particular judgment (gentle Reader) and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of the whole World, who I doubt not, will ſay no leſs, but that he is a man without fraud or guile, and ſuch a one as feareth God.</p>
            <p>As touching the Book it ſelf, good reaſon it is, each man ſhould uſe his own judgment and opinion. But if my ſimple Teſtimonial may prevail, I dare warrant it to be ſuch, that what ſtudy ſoever thou ſhalt beſtow in reading the ſame, it ſhall well requite thy pains. And though the Author be ſuch, that he rather delighteth in good and vertuous life, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth boaſt of any great learning: Yet ſuch hath his pains been herein, that very good Clerks need take no ſcorn, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light from this his Candel. In ſumm: the Book is of God, and his holy Saints, and therefore to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: collected out of Scripture, and therefore no vain fable: written briefly, and therefore not tedious: ſet forth in plain and ſimple wiſe, and therefore the better for thy capacity:
<pb facs="tcp:33800:4"/>truly reporting the life and death of ſuch, as either for ſin, (and thoſe to be avoided) either for vertue, (and thoſe to be imitated) have mention made in God's holy Book. All that is written therein, is written for thy help and inſtruction. Uſe it then to that end that the Author meaneth, that is: Not only to increaſe thy knowledge, and ſo to be made more learned: but alſo to increaſe thy vertuous life, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the better Man.</p>

Then they that had the charge of the Kings wicked act, for the old friendſhip of the Man, took him aſide privily, and prayed him that he would take ſuch fleſh as was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat, and diſſemble as though he had eaten even of the things appointed by the King, even the fleſh of the Sacrifice, that in ſo doing, he might be delivered from death, and that for the old friendſhip that was among them, he would receive this favour. But he began to conſider diſcreetly, and as became his age, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his ancient years, and the honor of his gray hairs, whereunto he was come, and his moſt honeſt converſation from his childhood, but chiefly the holy Law, made and given by God: therefore he anſwered them accordingly, and willed them ſtraightways to ſend him to the grave: for it becometh not our age (ſaid he) to diſſemble, whereby many young Perſons might think that <hi>Eleazar</hi> being 90. years old, were now gone to another manner of life. And ſo thorow mine hypocriſie (for a little time of a tranſitory life) they might be deceived by me, and I ſhould procure male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and reproach to mine old age. For though I were now delivered from the torments of Men, yet could I not eſcape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive nor dead. Wherefore I will now change this life manfully, and will ſhew my ſelf ſuch as mine age requireth. And ſo will leave a notable example for ſuch as be young, to die willingly &amp; couragiouſly, for the honorable &amp; holy laws:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33800:51"/>and when he had ſaid theſe words, immediately he went to torment.

And when he had brought <hi>Paul</hi> forth before his accuſers, and heard his accuſation made by one <hi>Tertullus</hi> an orator, <hi>Felix</hi> beckoned to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and when he had heard <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer, he deferred the examination of the matter until another time, ſaying
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33800:62"/>unto <hi>Pauls</hi> adverſaries, that for as much as <hi>Lyſias</hi> the chief Captain did know the whole matter as it ſtood, he would at his coming, hear them further. And ſo gave commandment unto his under Captain, that he ſhould in the mean ſeaſon keep <hi>Paul</hi> in ward, but yet ſo, that he might be gently ordered, and be ſometime at liberty, and that his familiars might freely repair unto him, and bring unto him ſuch things as he lacked. It was not long after this before <hi>Felix</hi> (being returned to <hi>Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> again with his wife <hi>Druſilla</hi> a Jew born) called forth <hi>Paul,</hi> being deſirous to have further knowledge of him as concerning the Sect that he profeſſed. And as <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto him of Righteouſneſs, of Temperance, and of Judgment to come, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled for fear, and ſent him away for that time, ſaying, that at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent leiſure he would ſend for him again. This corrupt Magiſtrate gaped for bribes and rewards to looſe <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore called him the oftner, thinking that <hi>Paul</hi> would have given him a piece of money to be delivered, but when he ſaw that none would come, and <hi>Portius Feſtus</hi> was ſent from <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor to ſucceed him in his room, than willing rather to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than to deliver <hi>Paul,</hi> left him in priſon bound. <hi>Felix,</hi> Happy.</p>

                  <hi>Portius</hi> (by <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor) was made Preſident in the room of <hi>Felix.</hi> Which <hi>Feſtus</hi> within three days after he came to his Province, went up from <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the High Prieſts and Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> informed him of <hi>Paul,</hi> deſiring his favour againſt him, and that he would ſend for him to have the matter pleaded there. Whoſe requeſt if <hi>Feſtus</hi> had granted, they were fully bent to have ſlain <hi>Paul</hi> in the way coming to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But <hi>Feſtus</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the priſoner ſhould remain at <hi>Ceſarea</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his coming, whither (ſaid he) I intend ſhortly to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33800:62"/>repair, and if there be any among you that is able to accuſe him, let them go down with me, and they ſhall be heard. And ſo when <hi>Feſtus</hi> was come to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> the next day after he ſate in judgment upon <hi>Paul.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the <hi>Jews</hi> laid many grievous complaints, which they were not able to prove, ſo long as <hi>Paul</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered for himſelf. Then <hi>Feſtus</hi> (willing to do the <hi>Jews</hi> a pleaſure) ſaid unto <hi>Paul:</hi> Wilt thou go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there be judged of theſe things before me? Then ſaid <hi>Paul;</hi> I ſee no cauſe wherefore I ſhould go thither, but may be judged as well here as there. But foraſmuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeek my condemnation againſt all right and Juſtice, I appeal to the Emperor. Well (ſaid <hi>Feſtus</hi>) thou haſt appealed to the Emperour, and to him ſhalt thou go. Within a few days after this it chanced that King <hi>Agrippa</hi> with <hi>Bernice</hi> his wife, came unto <hi>Ceſarea</hi> to ſalute and welcome <hi>Feſtus</hi> the new Preſident. And during the Kings aboad there, <hi>Feſtus</hi> (on occaſion) rehearſed <hi>Pauls</hi> matter unto him, ſaying: <hi>Felix</hi> my Predeceſſor left here a certain man in hold, whom the chief Prieſts and Elders of the Jews at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> complained of, deſiring me for their ſakes to give ſentence againſt him. To whom I anſwered, that it was not the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to give ſentence againſt any man, before his accuſers were brought before him, that he might make anſwer for himſelf. And ſo when his accuſers were come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I on the next day ſat in judgment, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priſoner to be brought forth before me, againſt whom his accuſers brought no accuſation of ſuch things as I ſuppoſed they would have done, but demanded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain queſtions of him concerning their own ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laying to his charge one <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was dead, whom he affirmed to be riſen from death to life again. And foraſmuch as I wiſt not well what to ſay in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I asked him whether he would go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33800:63"/>there be judged. And when he had refuſed that, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> I commanded him to be kept in priſon, until I might have occaſion to ſend him to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> Then ſaid the King to <hi>Feſtus:</hi> I have heard much of that ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Diſciples, and therefore am much deſirous to hear the fellow ſpeak my ſelf, before he go to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> Whereupon, <hi>Feſtus</hi> on the next morrow brought forth <hi>Paul</hi> into the common hall before <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King, ſaying on this wiſe: King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and you all that be here preſent, ye ſee this man, whom all the <hi>Jews</hi> have complained on to me, both at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer; and yet have I made inquiry, and can find nothing worthy of death that he hath committed: nevertheleſs, for as much as he hath appealed to the Emperour, I am determined to ſend him thither; and yet becauſe I have no certain thing to write unto his Majeſty, I have brought him forth before you, and ſpecially to thee King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that after examination had, I might have ſomewhat to write, for me-thinks it ſtandeth with no reaſon, to ſend a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not to ſhew withal what is laid to his charge. And when <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaw <hi>Paul</hi> ſtand before him,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>26.</hi> cap.</note> he ſaid: thou art permitted to ſpeak for thy ſelf, if thou haſt any thing to ſay in thy defence, ſay on. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak, and made ſuch a pithy declaration of his former life, and of his calling to Chriſt, that <hi>Feſtus</hi> (which was not skilful in the Jews religion) thought all his ſayings to be but madneſs, and cryed out with a loud voice, ſaying, that he was beſide himſelf, and that much learning had made him mad. Then after ſentence given by King <hi>Agrippa</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſent to the Emperor,<note place="margin">

To whom <hi>Moſes</hi> anſwered, ſaying: Shall your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren go harneſſed before the Lord, and ye ſit ſtill and do nothing? wherefore will ye diſcourage the hearts of the people? ſo did your Fathers when I ſent them from <hi>Cadeſh Barnea,</hi> to ſearch and ſee the land, diſcouraging the hearts of the people, reporting ſo much evil of the land, that they were ready to return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe doings did ſo provoke the Lord to anger, that he ſware that none of them all ſhould ſee that good land, ſave <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Therefore (ſaid he) if ye do now leave your brethren, and will not go harneſſed before them until the Lord hath caſt out their enemies, ye do ſo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33800:64"/>much ſin againſt the Lord, that he will ſurely find it out. And when they heard <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay ſo, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaying: We do not intend to leave our brethren, our meaning is nothing leſs than ſo to do, but rather that we might be ſuffered to make in this place ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds for our cattel, and houſes for our wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to leave them therein, which being done, we our ſelves will go forth before our brethren harneſſed, and will not return home to our houſes, until we have brought them to their places, and that every one of them be poſſeſſed in his inheritance.

And when they had done their commiſſion, the other anſwered, and ſaid, that God was their witneſs, that they had done it for no evil purpoſe, either to rebel againſt the Lord, or to ſwerve from his laws and ordinances in any point, but rather for this conſideration, to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between us and you, and our generations after us, leſt it ſhould chance another day, that your children ſhould ſay unto ours: what have ye to do with the Lord

Then ſaid <hi>Gedeon,</hi> O Lord, be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, if I prove thee once more: let now the fleece be dry only, and dew upon all the earth; and ſo in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the fleece was dry, and the ground all dewy. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> now, being thus confirmed, pitched his Hoſt to fight with his enemies. But when the Lord ſaw the number of his Army, he ſaid to <hi>Gedeon:</hi> The People that thou haſt with thee, are too many, therefore make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation thorowout all thine Hoſt, that whoſoever is timorous or fearful, let him depart home again; and there returned XXII. thouſand, and ten thouſand remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

So many as do lap the Water with their Tongues as Dogs do, ſhalt thou take with thee, and the reſt that kneel down upon their Knees to drink ſhalt thou refuſe, as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for this purpoſe.

And when they came near to the Hoſt they heard one Man ſay to another: I have dreamed a dream, and methought a loaf of Barley bread tumbled into the Hoſt of <hi>Midian,</hi> and came unto a Tent and ſmote it, that it fell and lay along on the ground.

When they perceived <hi>Joſhua</hi> to draw nigh unto <hi>Gibeon,</hi> they choſe out certain Men among them to ſend as Ambaſſadours to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and made their proviſion of dry and mouldy Bread: And put their Wine into old Bottles all rent and torn: and ſhod themſelves with old clouted ſhooes: and put on their backs old garments, and ſo ſent them forth to <hi>Joſhua</hi> to obtain peace. And when <hi>Joſhua</hi> looked upon them, and beheld their ſimple ſtate: he asked what they were, and from whence they came: They anſwered, from a far Countrey are thy Servants come becauſe of the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard of his fame and power, and what he did in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in all other places till now. And long have we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to come hither as ye may ſee; for this our food, the day we came forth was hot, our bottles, ſhooes, and garments all new, and now are they old and torn, and our Bread dry and mouldy, wherefore we ſhall deſire your favour and peace. Then <hi>Joſhua</hi> (believing it had been ſo) ſwore unto the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and made a covenant of peace with them, and let them go.

But when they ſaw that they were the People, which (a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) had obtained peace at their hands, they would not ſlay them, becauſe of their oath, but went to <hi>Joſhua</hi> and told him. Then <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſent for them, &amp; demanded where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had ſo deceived him. They anſwered, it was told us, that God commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi> to give you this Land, and to ſlay all the Inhabitants thereof, and therefore were we ſorced to make this proviſion for our lives.

The ſhaft of his Spear which he bare in his hand was like a Weavers beam. And the head upon the ſame weighed 600. ſhekels of Iron. This man being thus armed, came out from the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> (one bearing his ſhield before him) and ſtanding between the two Hoſts in a Valley, he cryed to the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying: Why are ye come to ſet your Battel in aray? am not I a <hi>Philistine,</hi> and you the ſervants of <hi>Saul?</hi> chooſe you out a Man, and let him come down to me.

Then <hi>David</hi> to ſtrengthen the weak faith of the King, ſaid thus unto him: As thy Servant was keeping his Father's Sheep, there came a Lion and a Bear likewiſe, and took a ſheep out of the Flock. Then I (not fearing the force of theſe two cruel Beaſts) ran out, firſt after the Lion, and took the prey out of his mouth, and in ſpite of his Beard I ſlew him. Likewiſe I ſerved the Bear.

And ſo, having that in his hand, and his Shepherds Bag about his Neck, with a few little Stones provided therein, he gat him down to the place where the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> ſtood waiting for a Man to encounter with him.

And curſing <hi>David</hi> by all his gods, he ſaid in a great fury: Am I a Dog, that thou comeſt to me with ſtaves, come hither my Child, and I will give thy fleſh to the Fowls of the Air, and Beaſts of the Field. Nay (quoth <hi>David</hi>) thou comeſt to me with Sword, Spear, and Shield, but I am come unto thee, in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom thou doſt deſpiſe and blaſpheme.

Nay ſaid <hi>Huſhai,</hi> but whom the Lord and this People, and all the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath choſen, his will I be, and with him will I dwell: to whom ſhall I do ſervice, but to his Son? as I ſerved before thy Father, ſo will I ſerve thee. Then when <hi>Abſalom</hi> had retained <hi>Huſhai</hi> to be of his Counſel, he ſaid unto him: <hi>Achitophel</hi> hath coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled thus and thus to do, ſhall we do thereafter or not? <hi>Huſhai</hi> anſwered, the Counſel that <hi>Achitophel</hi> hath given, is not good at this time. For (ſaid he) thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Father and his Men, how they be ſtrong, and now being chafed in their minds, are even as a Bear rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of her Whelps in the Field. And alſo thy Father is a Man practiſed in War: and maketh no tarrying with the People. Behold, he lurketh now in ſome Cave, or in ſome other ſtrong place, and though ſome of his Men be overthrown at the firſt brunt, it will be ſaid that thy People is overthrown, and ſo ſhall the beſt Men thou haſt (whoſe hearts are as the hearts of Lyons) ſhrink thereat. For all <hi>Iſrael</hi> knoweth thy Father to be a Man of great might, and his Warriors ſtout Men. Therefore my counſel is, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> be gathered together unto thee, from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> (which are in number as the Sand of the Sea.) And that thou go to Battel in thine own Perſon. For ſo ſhall we come upon him in one place or other, where we ſhall find him, and fall upon him as thick as the dew falleth upon the ground, and of all the Men that are with him, we ſhall not leave him one. Moreover, if he be gotten into a Town, then ſhall all the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> bring Ropes to that Town or City, and we will draw it into the River, until there be not one ſtone ſound there. This Counſel of <hi>Huſhai</hi> pleaſed <hi>Abſalom</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:33800:79"/>and the People, better than <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s: which was even the Lord's determination, to deſtroy the good counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that the Lord might bring evil upon <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom.</hi> And ſo when <hi>Huſhai</hi> had done according to <hi>David</hi>'s requeſt, he cauſed <hi>Sadoc</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſts, to ſend <hi>David</hi> word of all that was done, whereby he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.

And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> going on his Journey, came into the Eaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where (in beholding the Land) he ſaw certain Herdmen lying with their Flocks of Sheep beſide a Well (at the which they commonly uſed to water their Sheep) to whom he went &amp; demanded whence they were.

                  </note> put in her ſtead, for ſo much as it was not the cuſtome, that the younger ſhould be firſt married (as <hi>Laban</hi> alledged.)

Nay tarry, ſaid <hi>Laban,</hi> for I perceive that the Lord hath bleſſed me for thy ſake, appoint thy wages, and I will give it thee. Thou knoweſt (quoth <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>) what ſervice I have done thee, and in what taking thy Cattel hath been under me: for the little that thou hadſt before my coming, is now increaſed to a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.

I will go again and feed thy ſheep, and keep them, and will ſeparate all the ſheep of thy Flock one from another, and ſo many as be black, ſpeckled, or of party colour, let that be my wages, and whatſoever I take of the reſt unſpotted, let that be counted theft with me.

And when he had made this diviſion of <hi>Laban</hi>'s ſheep, he took Rods of green Poplar, of Haſel, and of Cheſnut-trees, and pilled white ſtrakes in them.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33800:81"/>of all, and in the end ſaid: This twenty years have I ſerved thee, xiv.

And when he had ſubdued the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and was coming homeward to his houſe, the firſt thing that met him out at his Doors, was his own Daughter, who for joy of her Father's Victory, came to meet him with Timbrels and Dances.

Now during the time of her Widowhood, it chanced-<hi>Holofernes</hi> to come and beſiege the City of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> of whom the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that they wiſt not what to do, but commit themſelves to God, for he had deſtroyed all their water Conduits, ſo that they muſt either be forced to ſtarve or yield. Then ran the People to <hi>Oſias</hi> the High-prieſt, crying upon him to yield and give over the City to <hi>Holofernes,</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:33800:106"/>leſt they ſhould all periſh, who exhorted them to tarry five days longer for the mercy of God, and if he helped them not in that ſpace, he would do as they had ſaid. Then <hi>Judith</hi> (who all this while had kept her houſe in prayer and faſting) hearing what promiſe <hi>Oſias</hi> had made to the People, ſent for him and all the Elders of <hi>Bethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and ſaid: How happeneth this that ye have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliver the City to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> unleſs within theſe five days, the Lord turn to help you: what Men are ye, that ye tempt the Lord? your device obtaineth no mercy of God, but rather provoketh him to wrath and diſpleaſure: Will ye ſet the mercy of the Lord a time, and appoint him a day at your will? exhort the People to repentance and prayer, and put them in remembrance of this: That with much tribulation the Friends of God are tryed, and that all theſe things which we now ſuffer, are far leſs than our ſins have deſerved: And that this correction is come upon us (as to the ſervants of God) for the amendment of our lives, and not for our deſtruction. Now hear my device (I pray you) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Lord to bring it to good end. Ye ſhall ſtand this Night in the Gate of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> and I will go out with <hi>Abra</hi> my Maiden: Pray ye unto the Lord that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the days that ye have promiſed to deliver up the City, he will viſit <hi>Iſrael</hi> by my hand. But inquire not of me the thing I have taken in hand, for I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, till God have finiſhed the act. Then every Man went their ways, and <hi>Judith</hi> departed home to her ſecret cloſet where ſhe made her hearty prayers unto God for the Peoples deliverance. Which being done, ſhe caſt off her mourning Garments, and decked her ſelf moſt bravely, to allure the eyes of all Men that ſhould behold her, which ſhe did not for any voluptuouſneſs or pleaſure of the fleſh, but of a right diſeretion and vertue: And ſo going out of her houſe with <hi>Abra</hi> her Maid, ſhe came to the Gate of the City, where the Elders ſtood waiting her
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33800:106"/>coming: And as they beheld her wonderful beauty, which God at that preſent had given her, they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly aſtoniſhed. She then commanding the Gates to be open, took her leave of the People, who moſt heartily beſought the Lord to be her defence, and well to perform the device of her heart, that they might ſafely and joyfully receive her preſence again: And ſo (committing her to God) ſhut the Gates, and looked over the Walls after her, ſo long as they could ſee her. And as ſhe was going down the Mountains, the firſt Watch of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> took her, demanding what ſhe was, and whither ſhe went. I am (quoth ſhe) a Daughter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and am fled from them, becauſe I know that they ſhall be given unto you to be ſpoiled: Wherefore I am going to the Prince <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofernes</hi> to tell him all their ſecrets, and how he ſhall win the City without the loſs of one Man. And when the Men had pondered her words and conſidered well her beauty, they put her in good comfort of her life &amp; brought her to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> whoſe Majeſty ſo abaſhed <hi>Judith,</hi> that ſhe fell down as one almoſt dead for fear. But being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived again, <hi>Holofernes</hi> demanded the cauſe of her coming, to whom ſhe made anſwer on this wiſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O my Lord, if thou wilt receive the words of thine Handmaiden, and do thereafter, the Lord ſhall bring thy matter to a proſperous effect. For as thy ſervant <hi>Achior</hi> gave counſel unto my Lord, to make ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had ſinned againſt their God or no: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and plain that their God is ſo angry with them for their ſins, that he hath ſhewed by his Prophets, that he will give them over into the enemies hand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſore afraid, and ſuffer great hunger, and at this preſent (for lack of water) are in a manner as dead Men, and in this extremity brought to kill their Cattel and drink the bloud: And alſo purpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the Wheat, Wine and Oil, which are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſanctified for the Prieſts, and not lawful for the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33800:107"/>People to touch. Wherefore I thy Handmaid knowing all this, am fled from their preſence, for God hath ſent me to work a thing with thee, that all the Earth ſhall wonder, for thy ſervant feareth the Lord, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth the God of Heaven day and night: And now let me remain with thee my Lord, and let thy ſervant go out in the Night to the Valley, and I will pray unto God that he may reveal unto me, when they ſhall commit their ſins, that I may ſhew them unto thee, and then mayeſt thou ſurely go forth with thine Army; for no Man ſhall reſiſt thee, and I will bring thee to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſuch ſafety, that there ſhall not ſo much as one Dog bark againſt thee. Now was <hi>Holofernes</hi> ſo well pleaſed with the words of this Woman, and ſo far in love with her beauty, that he commanded her Lodging to be made in the Tent where his Treaſure lay, and to prepare her Diet of the ſame that he himſelf did eat and drink of, but notwithſtanding ſhe told the King, that ſhe might not eat of his Meat, leſt ſhe ſhould offend her God, but I can ſatisfie my ſelf (quoth ſhe) with ſuch things as I have brought. Then how ſhall we do (quoth <hi>Holofernes</hi>) if theſe things that thou haſt brought do fail: where ſhall we have the like to give thee? As truly as the ſoul of my Lord liveth (quoth ſhe) thine Handmaid ſhall not ſpend all that I have, till God have brought to paſs in my hand, the thing that I have determined. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing licenſed to go out and in every night at her pleaſure to pray, ſhe went three nights together into the Valley of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> calling upon God to proſper her device, for the deliverance of his People, and at each time returned to her Tent again. And upon the fourth day as it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Holofernes</hi> (by God's providence) to make a great Banquet unto his Lords, he ſent <hi>Vago</hi> his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to <hi>Judith,</hi> to counſel her to come and keep Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him that Night: for it were a ſhame for us (quoth he) if we ſhould let ſuch a Woman alone and not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33800:107"/>talk with her; we will allure her, leſt ſhe do mock us. And when the Meſſenger had done his meſſage, &amp; brought <hi>Judith</hi> to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> his ſpirit (by and by) was moved and raviſhed with her beauty: Sit down now (quoth he) and drink with us and be merry: I will drink now my Lord (quoth ſhe) and rejoyce, becauſe my ſtate is exalted more than ever it was before. And ſo ſhe eat and drank before him, of ſuch things as her Maid had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Then <hi>Holofernes</hi> rejoyced ſo much in <hi>Judith,</hi> that he drank more Wine at that time, than ever he had done in one day before. Now when the evening was come, and every Man departed and gone to their Lodging: <hi>Vago</hi> the King's Chamberlain, ſhut the Chamber-door and went his way to Bed, leaving none but <hi>Judith</hi> in the Chamber with <hi>Holofernes,</hi> for her Maid was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtand without the Chamber-door, to wait her Miſtreſs coming forth to pray. And as <hi>Holofernes</hi> lay ſtretched along upon his Bed overcome with Wine, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith</hi> ſtood by his Beds ſide and prayed on this wiſe: O Lord God of all power, ſtrengthen me, and have reſpect unto the works of my hands in this hour, that thou mayſt ſet up thy City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> like as thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: O grant, that by Thee I may perform the thing which I have deviſed, and ſo took down his Sword, and holding him faſt by the hair of his Head, ſaid: Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then me, O Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in this hour; and with that ſmote off his Head, and rolled the dead Body aſide, and got her forth to her Maid, and put the Head in her Wallet, and went forth together, as though they had gone (as their cuſtome was) to pray. And ſo paſſing by the Hoſt, and coming nigh to the City of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> ſhe called to the Watchmen to open the Gate, for God is with us (quoth ſhe) and hath ſhewed his power in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when the Gates were ſet open, the People received her (young and old) with ſuch joy as never the like was ſeen. Then ſaid <hi>Judith:</hi> Oh praiſe ye the Lord, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33800:108"/>give thanks unto our God, which hath not taken away his mercy from the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but hath deſtroyed our enemies this Night by my hand: And behold here his Head, whom the Lord hath ſlain by me his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and returned his Handmaid without any reproach of villany, wherefore give praiſe and thanks to our God, whoſe mercy endureth for ever. Now take the Head, and hang it upon the higheſt place of your Walls, and in the morning when the Sun appeareth, go forth with your Weapons like valiant Men, and make as though ye would ſet upon your enemies, who will then prepare them to Armour: But when they ſhall go to raiſe up their Captain, and find him without a Head, there will ſuch a fearfulneſs fall upon them, that every Man will ſeek to ſave himſelf by flying, then do ye follow them without all care, for God hath delivered them into your hands. And ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> followed the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (which kept no order) and ſlew them down right. And when they had ſlain all their enemies, and gathered up the ſpoil, they gave the Tent of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and all that belonged to him, unto <hi>Judith,</hi> by whom God had ſo mightily wrought their deliverance, and had her in great honour, all the days of her life, who at the Age of an hundred and five years dyed, and was moſt honorably buried in <hi>Bethulia</hi> beſide her husband.

                  <hi>Levite and his Wife:</hi> There was a certain <hi>Levite</hi> dwelling on this ſide of Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> which took to Wife a Concubine out of <hi>Bethlehem Juda,</hi> which Woman played the Whore by him, and went away from him to her Fathers houſe, where ſhe remained four
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33800:110"/>Moneths. And at laſt, her Husband being deſirous to have her again, went to intreat her friendly, and to fetch her home, and was gently entertained of his Father-in-law, by the ſpace of three days. And on the fourth day, when he would have departed, his Father-in-law would not ſuffer him ſo to do, but with gentle entreaty, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to tarry that day alſo until the next morrow. Which being come, he prepared himſelf to depart. And about the mid-day (notwithſtanding the great intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Father, to have him yet to tarry one day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) he took his Concubine, his Servant, with two Aſſes laden, and ſo departed, going forth till they came as far as <hi>Jebus,</hi> and becauſe it drew toward night, his ſervant counſelled him to go into the City, and to tarry there all night, but his Maſter would not, becauſe it was a ſtrange City, and pertained not to the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And ſo paſſing by, they came to <hi>Gibeah</hi> a City belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the <hi>Benjamites.</hi> And coming thither ſomewhat late, they went in, and ſat them down in one of the ſtreets of the City. And as they were ſitting there, a certain old Man (which was of Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> alſo, and dwelt there as a ſtranger) came out of the Field from his work. And when he had ſpyed the Levite (and thoſe with him) ſitting in the ſtreet as wayfaring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he went unto them, demanding from whence they came? The Levite anſwered how that they came from <hi>Bethlehem Judah</hi> beſide Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and were going to the houſe of the Lord, and becauſe that no Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us into his houſe, we ſit here, having all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with us, both for our ſelves, and Cattel. Well (quoth the old man) abide not here in the ſtreet, but go home with me, and whatſoever ye lack, ye ſhall find it there. And ſo he had them home to his houſe, and uſed them very friendly. And as they were making merry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the wicked Men of the City came and beſet the Houſe round about, and thruſting at the Door to have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33800:111"/>been in, they called unto the old Man, to bring forth the Men out of his houſe, that they might know them. The good old Man, perceiving the great folly of thoſe ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons, went out unto them, and ſaid: Oh my good Brethren do not proſecute to accompliſh ſo wicked an act as this ye intend: yet rather than ye ſhould ſo wickedly abuſe theſe men, which are come into my Houſe, I will bring forth my Daughter (which is a Maid) and this Mans Concubine. But they in no wiſe would hearken unto them. The Levite ſeeing that, put forth his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine unto them: who ſo ſhamefully abuſed her that night, that on the morrow (when the Levite her husband came to open the Door) he ſound his Concubine lying with her hands ſtretched out upon the Threſhold, ſtark dead. Then he took her up upon his Aſs, and carried her home to his houſe, and took a Knife and divided her into twelve pieces, and ſent her into all the Quarters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that forſomuch as there was never ſuch a deed done, nor heard of, ſince the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they would conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and take adviſement therein. Now the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeeing this moſt evident token of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> wickedneſs, and having the whole matter revealed unto them by the Levite himſelf, they aſſembled together as it had been one Man, to the number of four hundred thouſand fighting Men, and came to <hi>Gibeah</hi> to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> who in the firſt day had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſlew of them xxii. thouſand, and in the ſecond day xviii. thouſand, but the third day, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had the better, and ſlew of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> xxv. thouſand, and burnt and deſtroyed all their Cities they could come by, with Man, Woman and Child, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix hundred of them fled to the Rock of <hi>Rimmon</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and ſaved themſelves there. Then <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> ſware unto the Lord in <hi>Mizpeh:</hi> that whoſoever did give his Daughter to any of the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to Wife, he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33800:111"/>ſhould be accurſed, and he that came not up to the Lords offering, ſhould ſurely die. And when they had reared up an Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and made their offering, it was known that the Inhabitants of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> came not up to the offering. Wherefore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſent thither xii. thouſand Men, commanding them to ſlay all the Males, with all the Women alſo, ſaving ſuch Women as had never known Man fleſhly. And they ſaved four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Damſels, Virgins that never lay with Man, and them they brought to the Hoſt of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which is in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having pity on their Brethren the <hi>Benjamites</hi> (becauſe that God had made ſuch a gap among them) went peaceably unto them that were fled unto the Rock of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> and gave them Wives which they had ſaved of the Women of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,</hi> but they ſufficed them not. Then the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were very ſorry for the breach that the Lord had made in the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and took great care for the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites,</hi> how to repleniſh them with Wives, forſomuch as their Women were all deſtroyed, and that they might not give their Daughters unto them: And at laſt, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the yearly cuſtome of the Daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> they ſaid unto the <hi>Benjamites:</hi> There is a Feaſt of the Lord yearly kept in <hi>Shiloh:</hi> Go ye thither, and lie in wait a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Vineyards, and when ye ſee the Daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> come dancing a row, then come ye out of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and catch you every Man a Wife. And if their Friends complain unto us, we will excuſe the matter, and ſay ye have done it, becauſe we did not reſerve to each one of you his Wife, in the time of War. And the Children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did even ſo, and took them Wives of the daughters of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and went to their Inheritance, and made them Cities to dwell in, and ſo were friends with their Brethren the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> again.</p>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.31.</note> was the Son of <hi>Haran,</hi> Brother to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with whom he went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> toward the ſouth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to come into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And when they were come to a place called <hi>Bethel,</hi> they had ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Sheep and Cattel between them, that (the Land not being able to receive them both) their Herdmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtrive together. Whereupon, <hi>Abraham</hi> (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void contention) deſired that <hi>Lot</hi> and he might break companies. And that he would take and occupy what part of all the Land he would, and he to take the other. Then <hi>Lot</hi> choſe the Countrey about <hi>Jordan,</hi> becauſe it had plenty of Water, and dwelt in <hi>Sodom,</hi> till <hi>Chedorlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> came and ſpoiled the City and carried <hi>Lot</hi> away Priſoner, who being reſcued by <hi>Abraham</hi> his Uncle, was brought to <hi>Sodom</hi> again.

And before his gueſts and he were gone to reſt, the Men of the City, (repleniſhed with all kind of wickedneſs) had compaſſed the houſe round about, and called to <hi>Lot,</hi> ſaying: Where are the Men which came in to thee this night? bring them forth to us that we may know them. Then <hi>Lot</hi> went out unto them and ſaid: I pray you my Brethren, do not ſo wickedly, yet rather than ye ſhould ſo do, I have two Daughters
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33800:113"/>which never knew Man, them will I bring out unto you, and do with them as ſeemeth you good, only to theſe men do nothing, for therefore are they come under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of my Roof. And as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> threatned <hi>Lot,</hi> and were preſſing upon him to break open the Door, the Angels within put forth their hands, and pulled <hi>Lot</hi> into the Houſe, and ſhut faſt the Door: At the which inſtant the <hi>Sodomites</hi> without were ſo ſmitten with blindneſs, that they groped for the Door and could not find it. Then ſaid the Angels to <hi>Lot:</hi> If thou haſt any Sons or Daughters or whatſoever thou haſt in the City, bring it out with thee, for we are ſent to deſtroy this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſins is great before the Lord. Then went <hi>Lot</hi> to his Sons in-law, who had married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and told them, but they (thinking their Father had mocked) tarried ſtill. And ſo as <hi>Lot</hi> made haſte (for the Angels could do nothing till he were gone) with his Wife and two Daughters to the City of <hi>Zoar,</hi> which he had requeſted of the Lord to flye unto, his Wife looking behind her (contrary to the Angels precept) was turned into a Pillar of Salt. Then <hi>Lot</hi> fearing to abide in the City of <hi>Zoar,</hi> (after the Cities were deſtroyed) got him into the Mountains, where he dwelt in a Cave, with his two Daughters, who (foraſmuch as their Father was old and not a Man left in the Country thereabout, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might have Children) conſulted together and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to make their Father drunk with Wine, and ſo to lye with him, that they might raiſe up Seed unto their Father.

                  <hi>Mattathias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Simeon</hi> the Prieſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2.</note> which was of the ſtock and kinred of <hi>Joaris,</hi> had five valiant Men to his Sons, and dwelt in <hi>Modin,</hi> remaining ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Laws of God, notwithſtanding the great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that were come upon the People of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> for the which <hi>Mattathias</hi> made piteous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33800:119"/>crying upon God to ſtrengthen him and his Sons againſt the Heathen, that had ſo waſted the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and defiled his Sanctuary. And while he and his Sons were thus mourning in Sackcloth, for the deſtruction of the holy City: <hi>Antiochus</hi> the King, ſent certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the City of <hi>Modin,</hi> to compel ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as were fled thither, to forſake their own Laws, and to ſerve the Idols of the Heathen. Who (after they had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart of many) ſpake to <hi>Mattathias</hi> on this wiſe: Thou art (ſaid they) a Noble man of high reputation, and great in this City, and haſt many Children and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Come thou firſt of all and fulfil the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, like as the Heathen have done, and the Men of <hi>Juda,</hi> with ſuch as remain at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo ſhalt thou and thy Sons be in favour with the King and greatly enriched. Nay ſaid <hi>Mattathias:</hi> Though all Nations under the King's Dominion, fall away every Man from the Law of their Fathers, yet will I, my Sons and my Brethren, walk in the Laws of our Fathers. God forbid we ſhould forſake the Laws and Ordinances of God, we will not, for no Man's pleaſure, tranſgreſs our Religion, or break the Statutes of our Law. And as he had ſpoken theſe words, a certain <hi>Jew</hi> came forth, and openly in the ſight of all Men, did ſacrifice unto the Idols upon the Altar in the City of <hi>Modin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the King's commandment, which thing ſo grieved <hi>Mattathias,</hi> that (for very Zeal he had to the Laws of God) he ſtarted him up, and ran upon the <hi>Jew,</hi> and killed both him &amp; the Commiſſioner, that compelled him ſo to do, and ran his way crying thorow the City, and ſaying to the People, whoſoever is fervent in the Law, and will keep and ſtand by the Covenant, let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me. So he and his Sons fled into the Mountains, and many other godly Men, with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all that they had, got them into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And being there, the Heathen went againſt them
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33800:119"/>on the Sabbath day, and ſlew Man, Woman and Child, for on that day the <hi>Jews</hi> would make no reſiſtance, but would dye in their innocency: Then <hi>Mattathias</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, was very ſorry, and counſelling with his friends, ſaid: If we do as our Brethren have done, and do not fight for our Lives, and our Laws, the Heathen will ſoon root us all out of the Earth, whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that whoſoever did bid them battel on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, that they would rather manfully fight for their Laws, than dye as their Brethren had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Upon the which concluſion, came the whole Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the <hi>Jews</hi> (with all ſuch as were fled for Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to <hi>Mattathias:</hi> And being gathered together, they were ſo great an Hoſt, that they feared not their enemies, but fell upon them and ſlew a great number. And by their force and ſtrength, they went about the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and deſtroyed the Altars, and circumciſed their Children and kept their Laws in ſpight of them all. Finally, when the time of his death drew nigh, he called all his Sons before him, exhorting them to prefer the Laws and wealth of their Countrey, before their own Lives, and ordained <hi>Simon</hi> his eldeſt Son, to be as it were their Father, and <hi>Judas Machabeus</hi> to be their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſo giving them his bleſſing he dyed, and was buried in his Fathers Sepulchre in the City of <hi>Modin.</hi>

This ambitious Man by deceit, got the High-Prieſt's Office from <hi>Jaſon</hi> on this wiſe: When that good and godly Man <hi>Onias</hi> had the ſuperiority, <hi>Jaſon</hi> his Brother found the means to corrupt <hi>Antiochus</hi> the King with Money, and ſo got the Office out of his Brother's hands. And when the time came that <hi>Jaſon</hi> ſhould pay the Money to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he ſent it by the hand of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> in whom he had great confidence. But when <hi>Menelaus</hi> was come to the King, he ſo craftily handled the matter with flattery and fair promiſes, that he both defrauded the King of his Money, and <hi>Jaſon</hi> of his Office: which when he had obtained, he return'd with an high ſtomach, more like a cruel tyrant, and the wrath of a wild brute beaſt, than any thing that beſeemed a Prieſt. But when the King had knowledge of all his deceit and falſhood, he diſcharged him again, putting <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> his Brother in his room. Then <hi>Menelaus</hi> being thus thruſt out of Office, waited his time to be revenged. And when he had ſpied the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his weighty affairs (as in the ſuppreſſion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rebels) leaving <hi>Andronicus</hi> behind him to be his Lieutenant, and ſuppoſing then to have a convenient time, he went and ſtole out of the Temple certain Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gold, and gave them to <hi>Andronicus.</hi> And after he had made him his aſſured friend, he miniſtred ſuch wicked counſel both to <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> his Brother, that the one murdered <hi>Onias,</hi> and the other ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and robbed the Temple of God. Wherefore the King at his return again, cauſed <hi>Andronicus</hi> to be put to death, and the other, the People furiouſly fell upon him and killed him. And forſomuch as <hi>Menelaus</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpected to be the chief cauſer of all this murther, a Court was called, and many ſore complaints laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33800:121"/>him. The <hi>Menelaus</hi> (perceiving himſelf in the King's diſpleaſure, and danger of his Laws) went to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (one of the three Ambaſſadours) and with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney made him his friend, who went to the King, and ſo laboured the matter, that he brought <hi>Menelaus</hi> into ſuch favour with the King again, that he was quite diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all accuſations, and his Accuſers condemned to death. Thus through covetous Magiſtrates, <hi>Menelaus</hi> remained ſtill in Authority, being now more malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto the <hi>Jews</hi> (his own Nation) than ever he was, as it appeared afterward, what time as he aided <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus,</hi> and was his guide to the ſpoiling of the Temple.

And ſo <hi>Naomi</hi> remained in <hi>Bethlehem Juda,</hi> where (ere it were long) God gave her a Son by the Womb of <hi>Ruth</hi> her Daughter-in law, who was married to <hi>Boaz,</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Naomi</hi>'s, which Child being born, the Women ſaid unto <hi>Naomi:</hi> Bleſſed be the Lord, the which hath not left thee without a Kinſman to have a name in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that ſhall bring thy life again and cheriſh thine old age, for thy Daughter-in-law which loveth thee, hath born unto him, and ſhe is better unto thee than ſeven Sons.

But having no Authority to condemn or put him to death, they brought him bound unto <hi>Pilate</hi> the Temporal Judge, ſaying, how that they had found him perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the People and forbidding Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf a King. <hi>Pilate</hi> hearing this, demanded of him, whether he were a King or no. <hi>Jeſus</hi> neither deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor affirming that he was, made anſwer that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> himſelf had ſaid ſo.

God made her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaying: There are two manner of People in thy womb &amp; two Nations ſhall be divided out of thy bowels: And the one Nation ſhall be mightier than the other: And the elder ſhall be ſervant to the younger. And ſo when her time was come to be delivered, ſhe brought forth two Twins, the one named <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the other <hi>Jacob.</hi> Which two became mighty Men, but <hi>Rebecca</hi> loved <hi>Jacob</hi> better than <hi>Eſau:</hi> and to prefer him before the other, ſhe ſaid: Hear me my Son <hi>Jacob,</hi> I have heard thy Father ſay to thy Brother, go and kill ſome Veniſon, and make me meat thereof, that I may eat and bleſs thee, before the Lord, before I dye. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Then ſaid <hi>Jacob:</hi> My Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> is a rough Man, and if my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall happen to feel me, I ſhall ſeem unto him, as if I went about to deceive him, and ſo ſhall I bring a curſe upon me, and not a bleſſing. Well (ſaid <hi>Rebecca</hi>) upon me be thy curſe my Son, only hear my Voice, and go and fetch me them. And when he had brought the Kids, and that ſhe had dreſt the Meat and made it ready, ſhe fetcht out certain Raiment of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s, and put it upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> and covered his hands and the ſmooth of his Neck with Goat-skins, and put the Meat in his hand to carry to his Father, by which policy of <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Jacob</hi> had his Brother's bleſſing. And when ſhe heard how his Brother threatned to kill him for ſtealing away his bleſſing, ſhe told it <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaying: Thy Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> threatneth to ſlay thee, therefore my Son hear my voice: Make thee ready, and get thee to <hi>Laban</hi> my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Haran:</hi> and tarry with him a while until thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fierceneſs be aſſwaged, and that his wrath be turned away from thee, and he forget the things which thou haſt done unto him, and then will I ſend and fetch thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thence, for why ſhould I be deprived of you both in one day? And when ſhe had given her Son this counſel, ſhe went to <hi>Iſaac</hi> her Husband and ſaid: I am weary of my life, for fear of the Daughters of <hi>Heth.</hi> If <hi>Jacob</hi> take a Wife of the Daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> ſuch a one as theſe are, or of the Daughters of the Land, what good ſhall my life do me? And ſo by the counſel of <hi>Rebecca, Jacob</hi> was ſent to <hi>Laban</hi> his Mother's Brother, where in proceſs he got him a Wiſe, and purchaſed the love of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> his Brother again.

Then <hi>Samuel</hi> (hearing them ſpeak of a King) was ſore diſpleaſed. But nevertheleſs, at the Lords commandment, who bad him make them a King, he firſt declared to them, the office and authority of a King, and then anointed <hi>Saul</hi> to be their King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom he ſent to <hi>Gilgal,</hi>

Behold, to obey is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken is better than the fat of <hi>Rams:</hi> for rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is as the ſin of Witcheraſt, and ſtubbornneſs is as the wickedneſs of Idolatry: And becauſe thou haſt caſt away the word of the Lord, therefore hath the Lord caſt away thee from being King. Then ſaid <hi>Saul:</hi> I have ſinned and gone further than the ſaying of the Lord, therefore take away my ſin, and turn again with me, that I may worſhip the Lord. Nay (quoth <hi>Samuel</hi>) I will not return with thee: for thou haſt caſt away the Lord, and he hath caſt away thee.

Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's name was <hi>Joachim,</hi> a Man of great reputation among the <hi>Jews.</hi> In the firſt year that <hi>Suſanna</hi> was married, there were two Judges made which reſorted much to <hi>Joachim</hi>'s houſe, and all ſuch as had any thing to do in the Law, came thither unto them. Theſe two Judges (being wicked men) were ſo wounded with the love of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and burned ſo in luſt after her, that they could not tell what to do: But neither durſt tell the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his grief, nor yet (for ſhame) utter their inordinate luſt unto her. And ſo on a day, when they had ſat long in <hi>Joachim</hi>'s houſe about matters of the Law, and waited for to have their purpoſe on <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and could not, they brake up and went home to dinner. And at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again together, the one brake to the other their whole minds, and appointed a time, when they might take her alone. And when they had ſpyed out a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, that <hi>Suſanna</hi> went into the Garden (as her manner was) with two of her Maidens only, to waſh her ſelf, theſe two hid themſelves in the Garden againſt her coming. And aſſoon as the Maidens had ſhut the Orchard-doors, and were gone for Oyl and Sope for their Miſtreſs, the two Elders came upon <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and ſaid: The Garden doors be now ſhut that no man can ſee us, and we burn in luſt towards thee, therefore conſent, and lye with us; if thou wilt not, we will bear
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:33800:160"/>witneſs againſt thee that a young Man was in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard with thee, and therefore thou ſenteſt away thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Then <hi>Suſanna</hi> ſighed and ſaid: If I do follow your minds, it will be my death: and if I conſent not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you I cannot eſcape your hands. It is better for me to fall into your hands without the deed doing, than to ſin in the ſight of the Lord. And with that cryed out with a loud voice, and the Elders cryed out againſt her; which clamour on both parties was ſo great, that it was heard among the Servants without, which ran to the Orchard door and burſt it open, to ſee what the matter was: And when the Servants had heard the Elders report of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> they were greatly aſhamed, for there was never ſuch a report made of <hi>Suſanna</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ſo on the next morrow, the two Elders (full of miſchievous imaginations) declared the matter to <hi>Joachim</hi> her husband to bring her to death. And when ſhe was come with her Father and Mother, her Children and all her kinred, to be judged according to the law, ſhe ſtood before the two wicked Judges with her Face covered, who commanded to take the Cloth from her face, that at the leaſt they might be ſatisfied with her beauty: which thing being done, the Judges ſtood up and laid their hands upon the head of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> ſaying: As we were walking in the Orchard alone, this Woman came in with her two Maidens, whom ſhe ſent away from her, making faſt the Orchard door after them. Then ſtarted there up a young Fellow which lay hid in the Garden, and went unto her, &amp; lay with her. Then we which ſtood in a corner ſeeing this wickedneſs, ran unto them, and ſaw them as they were together, but we could not hold the fellow, for he was ſtronger than we, and got open the door and leaped out: And when we demanded of her what fellow it was, ſhe would not tell us: This is the matter, and we be witneſſes of the ſame. Then <hi>Suſanna</hi> cryed out and ſaid: O everlaſting God, thou ſearcher

And as ſhe was led to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the place of execution, the Lord of Heaven which heard her prayer, raiſed up the ſpirit of a little Child called <hi>Daniel,</hi> who cryed with a loud voice, ſaying: I am clean from the blood of this Woman. And when the People heard that, they ſtayed to know of the Child what he meant by his words. O ye Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſaid he) are ye ſuch fools, that without examination and knowledge of the truth, ye have condemned a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> return again to Judgment, for they have born falſe witneſs againſt her. Then the People went back again, and the Elders took <hi>Daniel,</hi> and ſet him among them in Judgment. Who, when he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the two falſe witneſſes to be ſevered that he might examine them, he called the one before him and ſaid: O thou that art old in a wicked life, now thy ſins which thou haſt committed afore time, are come to light: Tell me under what Tree thou ſaweſt this Woman and the young fellow together? he ſaid, under a Mulberry Tree.
